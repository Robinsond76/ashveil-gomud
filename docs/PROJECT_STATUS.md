# Ashveil Project Status

Living status log for the Ashveil-on-GoMud migration. Update this file whenever a
commit lands or a phase completes, recording **what was done**, **why**, and
**which step/phase completed**. Keep it short and current; link to detailed docs
instead of duplicating them.

- **Last updated:** 2026-09-17
- **Branch:** `master`
- **HEAD:** `54305926 docs(company): mark companion slice plan complete`
- **Upstream baseline:** `39e44013 fix(telnet): stop Mudlet masking all input for the whole session (#633)`
- **Origin sync:** `master` is 14 commits ahead of `origin/master`; not pushed.

## Current position

- **Completed:** Phase 0–1 (fork, baseline, integration map) and Phase 2 (company
  companion slice).
- **Next:** Phase 3 — persistent 3×3 formation state.

## Recent work log

### Phase 2 — Company companion slice (complete, 2026-09-17)

- **What:** Added a durable, leader-keyed `company` model in `internal/company/`
  and a `modules/company/` plugin that persists the company record, spawns an
  allow-listed companion as a native GoMud mob, restores it after login/copyover,
  and exposes `company summon|status|dismiss`.
- **Why:** Prove a saved companion can be owned, followed, and restored without
  duplicating GoMud's party, mob, charm, movement, or persistence systems, and
  without an `ashveil*` layer.
- **Step completed:** Handoff Phase 2 ("Minimal Company Slice"). A durable
  `MobTemplateID` is stored; a runtime `InstanceId` is never persisted.
- **Key commits:** `8c1eca92` (model), `8be7c1f9` (restoration), `99f02261`
  (commands), `4dc1ea27` (attachment recovery + persistence-failure guards),
  `a4d71439`/`54305926` (wrap-up hygiene).
- **Verification:** `go test ./internal/company ./modules/company` (37 tests),
  `make validate`, and `go test -race ./...` (1394 tests / 65 packages) pass.
  Live Telnet acceptance passed (summon → native follow → dismiss → restart
  rehydration). `make test` is blocked locally by the `js-lint` stage (see
  Known issues).

### Phase 0–1 — Fork, baseline, integration map (complete, 2026-09-16)

- **What:** Forked GoMud into `Robinsond76/ashveil-gomud`, kept
  `GoMudEngine/GoMud` as read-only `upstream`, verified the vanilla baseline,
  and wrote the integration map, handoff, and phase plans.
- **Why:** Establish a clean, evidence-backed foundation before gameplay work.
- **Step completed:** Handoff Phases 0 and 1.
- **Key commits:** `1fba48a0` (BSD `awk` portability fix in `make help`),
  `6fd8c4b0` (baseline docs), `997d6db5`/`71c74f81`/`3cb4130c` (Phase 2 design
  and plan).
- **Verification:** Recorded in `docs/BASELINE_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Known issues / deferred items

- `make test` stalls in the `js-lint` stage because it shells out to `npx
  jshint`; the documented fallback `go test -race ./...` passes. Environmental,
  not a code failure.
- Plugin `WriteStruct`/`WriteBytes` persistence is a direct (non-atomic) file
  write. Command state rolls back on failure, but a partial low-level write
  cannot be recovered.
- Live server acceptance has not been re-run on the final Phase 2 fix commit;
  native integration tests cover the lifecycle instead.
- Deferred by design: recruitment economics, five-member company cap, formation,
  human company members, equipment, injuries, AI orders, death rules, and
  travel/camp integration.
